# RepoPilot Agent Worker

This module will host the LangGraph workflow for long-running RepoPilot agent runs.

Current slice:

- `GET /health` returns worker health.
- `POST /runs/{run_id}/start` accepts a run contract and returns the planned MVP graph nodes.
- `../scripts/agent-worker-smoke.sh` starts or reuses the worker and verifies both contracts.

## Local Contract Smoke

```bash
../scripts/agent-worker-smoke.sh
```

The smoke script checks:

- FastAPI dependencies are importable.
- `/health` returns `status=UP` and `service=agent-worker`.
- `/runs/303/start` returns `accepted=true`, `status=QUEUED` and the expected MVP graph node list.
- Evidence is written to `output/agent-worker-smoke/last-run.json`.

## Backend Start Bridge

The Spring Boot backend can shadow-dispatch a run start contract to this worker when configured:

```yaml
repopilot:
  agent-worker:
    enabled: true
    base-url: http://127.0.0.1:8090
```

When enabled, backend run execution records an `agent_worker_start` step with the worker response. If the worker call fails, the failure is recorded as step evidence and the current Spring Boot executor continues as the local fallback.

Next implementation steps:

1. Add Backend API client for run and step updates.
2. Add MCP client for repository tools.
3. Implement LangGraph nodes from `docs/technical/agent-workflow.md`.
4. Persist step events back to the Spring Boot backend.
